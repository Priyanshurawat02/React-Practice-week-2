## Week 2 - February 17, 2026

### What I Learned
- useEffect hook (when and why it runs)
- Dependency arrays ([], [value], none)
- Cleanup functions (clearInterval, removeEventListener)
- API fetching with fetch()
- Promise chaining (.then().then().catch())
- Loading and error states
- Conditional rendering for async data

### Components Built
- TitleUpdater (document.title with useEffect)
- Timer (setInterval with cleanup)
- WindowSize (addEventListener with cleanup)
- UserList (real API fetch with loading/error)

### Key Concepts Understood
- Why .then() is used twice in fetch
- [] = run once, [val] = run on change
- Always clean up listeners and intervals
- fetch gives envelope first, .json() opens it

### Next Goals
- Challenge 30: Post Viewer (multiple fetches)
- Challenge 31: Searchable User Directory
- useRef hook
